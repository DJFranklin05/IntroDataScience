# IntroDataScience

Prompt list:
 have a csv file called card_transdata, import that as well as the necessary libraries like seaborn, matplotlib, and pandas
I want you to do these things in my current notebook file
check for missing values
go back to the import cell and import numpy
git rid of the heatmap
drop rows with missing values
give me a countplot of the fraud column
also give me count plots for Used Pin and Repeat Retailer
it should be used_pin_number
I want to see them individually, not all three next to each other, it makes them too small
do one for Online orders
make a histogram of the ratio to median purchase price
make a bivariate countplot of the pin usage with hue based on if it was fraud
Create a percentage plot to show the percentage of fraudulent transactions when a PIN was used or not
this is close, but the percentages should add up to 100% and show percentages that weren't fraud. It should be a stacked bar chart and have a hue difference to show fraud
repeat the last two charts but with online orders. And make the charts with less lines of code
Create a scatter plot to show the breakdown of fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions for distance_from_last_transaction vs ratio_to_median_purchase_price
Create a scatter plot to show the breakdown of fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions
okay perfect, but make the last two plots less transparent
do not generate code here. Respond to this message with a list of every prompt I have given in this chat
